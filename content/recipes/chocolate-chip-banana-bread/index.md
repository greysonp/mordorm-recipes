# Ingredients

## Dry
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt


## Wet
- 3 medium bananas  
  _Ideally very ripe, but I've often used normal bananas and it comes out just fine_
- 3/4 cup sugar  
  _I've used normal sugar, cane sugar, and coconut sugar -- all work fine_
- 1/2 cup plant milk  
  _I've used soy, almond, and oat -- all good_
- 1/2 cup neutral oil  
  _I've used both canola oil and vegetable oil_
- 1 tsp vanilla

## At the End
- 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips  
  _This is all up to personal preference -- follow your heart_

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F
1. In a large bowl, combine your wet ingredients.  
  _I like to start with the banana and sugar first, then add the rest._
1. In a medium bowl, combine your dry ingredients.
1. Slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, whisking as you go.
1. Add in as many chocolate chips as you want. At this point, it's usually easier to fold them in with a spatula.
1. Get a 9-inch loaf pan, spray it with cooking spray, spread a sheet of parchment paper across, then add more cooking spray. The parchment paper will give you good handles to lift the bread out later (see photos).
1. Bake for 55-65 min. Test with a skewer to make sure the inside is cooked. Note that it can be tough to tell the difference between the batter and a gooey chocolate chip, so just use your best judgement.
2. After you take it out of the oven, let it rest in the pan for 15 min.
3. Finally, transfer it to a cooling rack. You're going to want to let this cool for at least an hour. Sure, super warm and fudgy banana bread is great, but if you want the classic glazey-looking top and denser texture, do yourself a favor and give it some time :)
