# Ingredients

## Dry
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt


## Wet
- 3 bananas  
  _Ideally very ripe, but I've often used normal bananas and it comes out just fine_
- 3/4 cup sugar  
  _I've used normal sugar, cane sugar, and coconut sugar -- all work fine_
- 1/2 cup plant milk  
  _I've used soy, almond, and oat -- all good_
- 1/2 cup neutral oil
  _I've used both canola oil and vegetable oil_
- 1 tsp vanilla

## At the End
- 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips  
  _This is all up to personal preference -- follow your heart_

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F
1. In a large bowl, combine your wet ingredients.

    Note that there's two lines for canola oil -- that's because 2/3 cups + 3 Tbs doesn't come out to a nice round number. But the extra 3 Tbs is important to get the right texture.
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together your dry ingredients.
1. Slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, whisking as you go. After everything is combined, you should have a texture that is doughy, but still slowly drips/falls off the whisk.
1. Add in as many chocolate chips as you want. At this point, it's usually easier to fold them in with a spatula.
1. Place on a cookie sheet with some room to spare -- these will spread. I highly recommend a cookie scoop. This recipe should make ~24 1.5 Tbs cookies.
1. Bake for 11-14 minutes, or until you just start to see the edges brown. Let cool for 5 minutes on the sheet afterwards before moving to a wire rack.

    The cookies will be very soft when they come out, but should firm considerably. Warm cookies are always great, but I particularly love these after they've cooled completely, at which point they'll be a bit chewier.
