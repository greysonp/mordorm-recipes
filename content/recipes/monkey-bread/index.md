# Ingredients 

## Dough Phase 1
- 1 1/2 cups plant milk (warmed)
- 2 1/4 tsp yeast (1 packet)
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar

## Dough Phase 2
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup butter, melted
- 1 cup all purpose flour

## Dough Phase 3
- 3-4 cups of all purpose flour

## Sugar Coating
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 Tbs cinnamon
- 3/4 cup butter, melted


# Instructions
1. Microwave the plant milk for 60-90 seconds until it's warm like bathwater.
1. Combine all of Dough Phase 1 into a stand mixer and whisk to combine.
1. Add Dough Phase 2 into the stand mixer and mix on low until combined.
1. Add Dough Phase 3 into the stand mixer, starting with just 3 cups. Mix until it clears the sides of the bowl.
1. If the dough is very sticky, add some of the remaining cup. You want the dough to be tacky but workable.
1. Knead using the stand mixer for another 2 minutes.
1. Place the dough in a large greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap.


> Let rise for 1-2 hours.  
> _Until doubled in size_ 

8. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
1. Spray your cooking pan with non-stick spray. The traditional shape uses a bundt pan, but cake pans or oven-safe glass bowls are other good options.
1. Whisk the sugars and cinnamon together for the Sugar Coating. The melted butter goes in a separate bowl.  
    _Use wide-mouthed bowls. We're going to be dipping and rolling things in them._
1. Roll the dough out into a square that's about 1" thick. It doesn't have to be perfect. Then, cut the dough into roughly 64 pieces (AKA an 8x8 grid, hence the square). If the pieces are different sizes or you have less than 64, that's ok.
1. For each piece:
    1. Roughly roll it into a ball.
    1. Coat in butter.
    1. Coat in sugar.
    1. Place in your pan.

_If preparing ahead of time, stop here and place your pan in the fridge overnight. Before baking, let it warm to room temperature._

13. If you have any remaining melted butter, feel free to drizzle it over everything.
1. If your pan is looking pretty full, I highly recommend placing it on a baking sheet before putting it in the oven. This will rise quite a bit, which may cause hot sugar to spill out.
1. Bake for 30-35 minutes.
1. Let sit for 10-15 minutes.
1. Before serving, turn it upside down onto a serving plate.
1. Enjoy!
