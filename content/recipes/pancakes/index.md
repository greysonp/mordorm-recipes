# Yield
~6 pancakes using a 1/3 cup as a scoop

# Ingredients 

## Dry
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Wet
- 1 cup non-dairy milk  
  _I prefer oat  milk_
- 1 tsp apple cider vinegar  
  _I've left it out before and it's fine_
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
  _I've left it out before and it's fine_

# Instructions

1. Heat up a frying pan to medium-low heat.  
1. Mix together all of the dry ingredients.
1. Mix together all of the wet ingredients.  
    _I like to measure the oat milk in a liquid measuring cup, and then just add the vinegar and vanilla directly to the cup to minimize the number of bowls used._
1. If you have any mix-ins (chocolate chips, blueberries, etc), I recommend mixing them in now.
1. Pour a scoop of batter onto the frying pan. When you see bubbles popping through the batter, use a spatula to peek underneath. If it's golden brown, flip the pancake and cook for another 30s or so.  
    _Every stove is different, and getting the temperature right is the hardest part. Too low, and they'll take forever to cook and come out rubbery. Too high, and they'll cook too fast, leaving the center uncooked. Accept the fact that the first couple pancakes may not be perfect._
1. Enjoy!
