# Ingredients

## Dough
- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 1 Tbs sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 package active dry yeast
- 22 oz all-purpose flour (4 1/2 cups)
- 2 oz unsalted butter, melted (4 Tbs)

## Boiling
- 10 cups water
- 2/3 cups baking soda

# Instructions

1. Combine the water, sugar, salt, and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer.

> Wait 5 minutes  
> _Until frothy_

2. Add flour and melted butter to the bowl.
1. Mix on low until well combined.
1. Mix on medium and mix until dough is elastic and supple.
1. Remove the dough from the bowl, spray the bowl with pam (or rub with vegetable oil) and place your dough back in. Cover with a towel.

> Let rise for 1 hour  
> _Until doubled in size_

6. Preheat the oven to 450 F.
1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
1. Bring the water and baking soda to a boil.
1. Meanwhile, divide the dough into 8 pieces and cover with a towel. 

   _Use a scale to help guarantee all of your pretzels will be the same size._

1. Roll each dough ball into a 24-inch rope. One way to do this would be to first roll the ball out into a ~8-inch rectangle, roll tightly into a tube, and then roll that out into a rope. Doing the initial tube roll can improve the resulting texture. Alternatively, just roll it directly into a rope.
1. To turn the rope into a pretzel, first lay out the pretzel in a U shape. Then cross the two ends one or twice, depending on what style you're going for. Then bring the intersection down to the bottom of the U and gently press.
1. Place pretzels, two at a time, into the boiling water. Let boil for 30 seconds, remove using a spider or spatula, and then place on a baking sheet. Each baking sheet should hold 4 pretzels.

   _You might see the pretzels unfold a bit in the boiling water. It'll be ok. They'll stick back together when they bake._

1. Bake for 13-16 minutes, turning half-way if you can be bothered.
1. After taking them out of the oven, let them sit for at least 5 minutes on a cooling rack before eating. Enjoy!
