# Ingredients 

## Wet
- 1 cup plant milk
- 1 Tbs apple cider vinegar or lemon juice
- 1/2 cup neutral oil

## Dry
- 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour, plus 1/4 cup as needed
- 2 Tbs baking powder
- 2 tsp granulated sugar
- 1 tsp salt

_Yields enough for ~12 2" biscuits._

# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 425 F.
1. Combine plant milk and vinegar/lemon juice to make a 'buttermilk'. We want it to sit together for a bit while we do later steps.  
  _I find it easiest to use a liquid measuring cup, and then you can add the oil to the same cup later on._
1. Combine all of the dry ingredients.
1. Combine all of the wet ingredients.
1. Combine the wet and dry ingredients.  
1. The dough should be tacky yet workable. Use the extra 1/4 cup of flour if it's too tacky.
1. Smoosh the dough out on a table until it's about 1" thick. You can use a rolling pin if you'd like.
1. Fold it over itself and flatten again. Do this 2 or 3 more times.
1. Use a 2" round cookie cutter (or a narrow mouthed glass) to cut out the biscuits. You won't be able to get all 12 in one go. You'll have to gather the scraps, reform, and cut some more.
1. Place on a lined baking sheet so they're touching each other.
1. Use your finger to make a little dimple in the middle so that they'll be flat after they rise.
1. If you'd like, you can brush a little liquid (oil/butter/buttermilk) on the top of each one, but it's not super necessary.
1. Bake for 15-20min.
1. Enjoy!
