# Ingredients 

## Dry
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup cocoa powder
- 3/4 tsp baking powder 
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Wet
- 1/2 cup vegan butter, melted 
- 1 1/2 cup sugar 
- 1/3 cup non-dairy milk 
- 3 tsp vanilla extract

## Other
- 1 cup chocolate chips

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
1. Mix together all of the dry ingredients.  
    _You're going to use two bowls -- put the dry ingredients in the smaller one if they're different sizes._
1. Mix together all of the wet ingredients. Start with the butter + sugar first.
1. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet and combine.
1. Mix in your chocolate chips.
1. Line an 8x6 baking dish with parchment paper and Pam.
1. Pour the batter into the dish and spread it evenly.
1. Baking time can be a little finnicky. Start with 35 min. If a fork test shows there's still some uncooked batter, bake in increments of 3-5 min. I've gone up to 45 in the past, at which point it was a tad overdone.  
    _A fork test may come out 'dirty' because it hit a chocolate chip. That's ok! You just don't want uncooked batter._
1. Let cool for at least an hour before eating. Otherwise it'll be _too_ fudgy!
