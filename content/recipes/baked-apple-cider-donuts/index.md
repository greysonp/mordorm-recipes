# Ingredients

## Donut 
- 1 cup all-purpose flout
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg
- 1/8 tsp allspice  
  _If you don't have allspice, just add more cinnamon_
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1/3 cup apple cider  
  _I've used darker-colored apple juice, and it works great_
- 1/4 cup apple sauce
- 1 Tbs coconut oil, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Glaze
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 Tbs apple cider

## Topping
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg


# Instructions

## Donut
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
1. In a medium or large bowl, combine your dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt. Whisk together.
1. In a separate bowl, combine your wet ingredients: maple syrup, apple cider, apple sauce, coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk together.
1. Add your wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
1. Transfer the batter to a piping bag and pipe into a greased donut pan. Shoot for around 75% full.
1. Bake for 8-10 minutes, until the donuts spring back when gently pressed.
1. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack and letting them cool completely.  
    _Remember that you can't put icing on something hot/warm -- it won't set!_

## Glaze + Topping
1. In a small shallow bowl (something just a bit larger than your donuts), whisk together the powdered sugar and apple cider.  
    _It'll seem dry at first, but once the powdered sugar hydrates, it'll get to a nice consistency._
1. In a separate small bowl, combine all ingredients for the topping.
1. Once the donuts have cooled completely, dip the donuts into the glaze.  
    _I like to do this with two hands. The donuts are relatively fragile, and the glaze can be suction-y, so you want multiple points of contact lifting the donut._
1. Immediately after dipping, coat with a generous sprinkle of the topping.
