# How to add recipes

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
1. To make a new recipe, I recommend starting by just copy-pasting an existing one in `content/recipes`.
1. To see your changes, run `hugo server`.
1. I'm lazy and I commit the generated files to make deploys easier, so do a plain `hugo` call to generate the site before committing.
