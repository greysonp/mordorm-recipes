<ul>
<li>1/3 cup auafaba<br>
<em>I reduced the water from a can of chickpeas by half, worked great. However, I&rsquo;ve seen videos online where they just use the aquafaba directly. YMMV.</em></li>
<li>1/4 tsp cream of tartar</li>
<li>66 g sugar<br>
<em>You might want something smaller-grained than the typical super-course-grained cane sugar</em></li>
<li>110 g powdered sugar</li>
<li>110 g almond flour</li>
<li>1 cup strawberry jam</li>
<li>2 drops red food coloring, optional</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="instructions">Instructions</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Preheat the oven to 310 degrees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a stand mixer, add your aquafaba and cream of tartar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix on low for 1 minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix on medium for 2 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raise speed to high and start adding the sugar slowly over a few minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep mixing until you have stiff peaks. A few minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sift together the powdered sugar and almond flour.<br>
<em>Sifting is considered to be important to prevent clumps in our batter.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold the dry ingredients into your whipped aquafaba with a rubber spatula. A good strategy would be to use consistent &ldquo;J&rdquo; motions. It&rsquo;s not that delicate of a mixture, but don&rsquo;t go too crazy. It can take some time to get everything absorbed.</p>
<p>The tricky part here is to get the batter to the right consistency. You want to keep mixing until you can take a big scoop, hang your spatula, and see it flow off the spatula slowly and relatively smoothly, with the drippings blending into the batter in the bowl. It won&rsquo;t be like liquid &ndash; it&rsquo;ll still sort of blob off &ndash; the main thing is that you don&rsquo;t want it to be stiff. We want these things to spread just a little in the next step.</p>
<p>(If you&rsquo;d like, you can add some red food coloring now)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer your mixture to a piping bag. Pipe into ~24 circles on to a baking sheet lined with either a silicon baking mat or parchment paper.</p>
<p>The mixture should be such that you can pipe it into a circle by just making one &ldquo;plop&rdquo;. It should spread just a little bit, enough that it smooths itself out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After piping, pick up your sheet and drop it on the table a few times. This will help reduce air bubbles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, take a toothpick and pop any bubbles you see. Don&rsquo;t worry, the mixture with smooth itself out after you pop them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Let rest 15 minutes.<br>
<em>Until the shells feel dry to the touch.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="12">
<li>Bake for 20 minutes total, rotating the sheet every 5 minutes.</li>
<li>At this point, you should have a set of wonderful shells. Let them cool completely.</li>
<li>You can do many, many different kinds of fillings. A simple one is just strawberry jam. Put the jam into a piping bag, pipe onto a cookie, and sandwich another on top.</li>
</ol>
