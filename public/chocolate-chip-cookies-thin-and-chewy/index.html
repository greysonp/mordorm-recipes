            <h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h1>
<h2 id="dry">Dry</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wet">Wet</h2>
<ul>
<li>2/3 cup canola oil<br>
<em>Same amount of peanut butter also works if you want to mix it up</em></li>
<li>2/3 cup granulated sugar<br>
<em>Coarse sugar really doesn&rsquo;t work here &ndash; you want something fine-grained</em></li>
<li>2/3 cup brown sugar<br>
<em>I used dark, but light probably works fine</em></li>
<li>1/2 cup plant milk<br>
<em>I&rsquo;ve used unsweetened oat milk and almond milk successfully</em></li>
<li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="instructions">Instructions</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350 F</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a large bowl, combine your wet ingredients.</p>
<p>Note that there&rsquo;s two lines for canola oil &ndash; that&rsquo;s because 2/3 cups + 3 Tbs doesn&rsquo;t come out to a nice round number. But the extra 3 Tbs is important to get the right texture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together your dry ingredients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, whisking as you go. After everything is combined, you should have a texture that is doughy, but still slowly drips/falls off the whisk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add in as many chocolate chips as you want. At this point, it&rsquo;s usually easier to fold them in with a spatula.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place on a cookie sheet with some room to spare &ndash; these will spread. I highly recommend a cookie scoop. This recipe should make ~24 1.5 Tbs cookies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake for 11-14 minutes, or until you just start to see the edges brown. Let cool for 5 minutes on the sheet afterwards before moving to a wire rack.</p>
<p>The cookies will be very soft when they come out, but should firm considerably. Warm cookies are always great, but I particularly love these after they&rsquo;ve cooled completely, at which point they&rsquo;ll be a bit chewier.</p>
</li>
</ol>
