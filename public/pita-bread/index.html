    <section class="recipe">
      <h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>2 tsp active dry yeast<br>
<em>You can just use one standard packet</em></li>
<li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
<li>345 g unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="instructions">Instructions</h1>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the yeast and sugar with 1 cup of lukewarm water. Whisk to dissolve.</li>
<li>Add in the whole-wheat flour and 30g of the all-purpose flour. Whisk to dissolve.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Let rest for 15 minutes.<br>
<em>Until frothy and bubbly</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add the salt, olive oil, and 220g of flour, keeping the remaining 60g of flour in reserve.</li>
<li>Stir until the mixture forms a shaggy mass. Dust with some of the reserved flour, then knead in the bowl for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Turn the dough onto a work surface. Knead lightly for 2 minutes, let rest for 10 minutes, then knead again for 2 minutes.
You want to use the minimum amount of your reserve flour. The dough school be soft, moist, and slightly tacky, while still being easy to handle.</li>
<li>Clean and lightly grease your large mixing bowl. Put the dough back in, cover it tightly with plastic wrap</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Let rise for 1 hour.<br>
<em>Until doubled in size</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>While the dough is rising, preheat your over to 475 degrees. For a cooking surface, use one of the following, ordered by preference: pizza steel, pizza stone, cast iron pan, or heavy baking sheet.</p>
<p>The idea is that we want something that will get very hot and retain a lot of heat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place your cooking surface of choice on the bottom rack of your oven to get it nice and hot. Especially for a pizza steel/stone (which can take a while to heat up), you want it in the oven for the full hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After your dough has risen, punch it down and divide into 8 equal pieces.<br>
<em>I recommend using a scale if you want nice, evenly-sized pitas.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll each piece into a little ball and place them either on your work surface or a piece of parchment paper. Cover them with a damp towel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Let rest for 10 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p>Depending on your cooking surface, you can probably only cook one or two pitas at a time. Even if your surface is quite large, it&rsquo;s worth noting that they can be tricky to flip, so you&rsquo;ll want to give yourself some extra room.</p>
<p>So, working either one or two at a time (leaving the rest covered), take the balls and flatten them into disks using a rolling pin. You should be shooting for around 8&quot; in diameter and between 1/8&quot; and 1/4&quot; thickness.</p>
<p>You may need a little flour on your rolling pin to prevent sticking, but try not to put any on your work surface &ndash; the tackiness of the dough on the surface will make it much easier to roll them out thin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take your disks and place them directly on your cooking surface.<br>
<em>Rather than drop them flat (which can cause a lot of wrinkling), I recommend placing one edge down first and then lowering the rest down quickly and carefully.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let your pitas bake for 2 minutes one one side, at which point they will (hopefully) be nicely puffed. Then flip and bake for 1 more minute. The pitas should be largely pale with some brown spots. You don&rsquo;t want any char.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After removing from the oven, place them on a wire rack to cool.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat for the remaining dough balls.</p>
</li>
